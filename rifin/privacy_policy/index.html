            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>YOUR_COMPANY_OR_DEVELOPER_NAME</strong>
                (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information
                when you use the <strong>YOUR_APP_NAME</strong> iOS application
                (“the App”).
            </p>
            <p>
                By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information
                in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>YOUR_APP_NAME</strong> is designed to operate as a
                <em>LOCAL-ONLY / OFFLINE</em> application. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal
                    data on our own servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.1 Data You Provide in the App</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on how you use the App, you may enter information such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial records, expenses, income, or budget information</li>
                <li>Notes or other personal data you manually input</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This information is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is
                not transmitted to us.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <p>
                We do <strong>not</strong> collect analytics, usage data, or other
                telemetry by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you enable any optional analytics or crash reporting service in the
                future (for example, via Apple or a third-party provider), this will
                be clearly indicated within the App, and you will be given the
                relevant privacy details at that time.

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                Because we do not receive or store your personal data on our own
                servers, we do not use your information for advertising, tracking, or
                profiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any data you enter into the App is used solely to provide the
                features and functionality of <strong>YOUR_APP_NAME</strong> on your
                device (for example, to calculate budgets, track expenses, or display
                historical records).

        <section class="card">
            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>
                All data is stored locally on your device, using the storage
                mechanisms provided by iOS (for example, local database or
                encrypted storage if applicable).
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend that you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use a device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect access to
                    your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regularly update iOS to the latest version to benefit from the
                    latest security updates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you choose to back up your device via iCloud or another backup
                service, your App data may be included in those backups and will be
                subject to the backup provider’s privacy policy.

        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>YOUR_APP_NAME</strong> does not require an account or login
                and does not directly share your data with third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the App may use services provided by Apple or the iOS
                operating system, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notifications:</strong> If you enable notifications, iOS
                    may process notification delivery as part of the operating system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>System Backup:</strong> Your App data may be included in
                    device backups.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
            </p>
            <p>
